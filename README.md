# 3D Platformer

I've made this little game to follow along with the Zenva Academy Unity Mini-Degree Course. Here it is a few functionalities that I've implemented on it:
 
 - Movement
 - Jump
 - Simple UI
 - Enemies
 - Coin bob and pickup
 
 It's not a pretty project or something like that, is only for study pourposes.
